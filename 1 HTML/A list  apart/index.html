        <p>It's an important time to be in voice design, bit it's not without its own challenges. Content in voice-driven interfaces can vary wildly from that of traditional websites, which might leave many of us wondering about our existing approaches to usability testing. Preston So not only shows us how to refram e these challenges into opportunitiesm but as advantages for the medium itself.</p>

<h2>From URL to Interactive</h2>

    <p>When we think about it, our whole industry depends on our faith in a handful of "black boxes" few of us fully understand: browsers. We hand over our HTML, CSS , JavaScript cross our fingers, and hope they render the experience we have in our heads. But knowing how they work can really get you out of a jam when things go wring. That's why we've assembled a handful of incredibly knowledgeable authors to take us under the hood in this four-part series. Join us on this trip across the web, into the often foggy valley between code and experience.</p>
